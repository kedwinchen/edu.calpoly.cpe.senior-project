# Containers

- Compared to [[20210118-192202_vm.md]] [Virtual Machines](20210118-192202_vm.md), containers appear to be more lightweight
    - requires less disk space
    - runs on a container runtime
- However:
    - Container runtimes may not be natively supported (macOS, Windows), and thus may end up running in a VM anyway
    - configuration file syntax may be difficult to understand/write

Popular tools:

- Docker
- LXC/LXD (Linux-based OS only)
