# Virtual Machines

- Compared to [[20210118-192156_containers.md]] [Containers](20210118-192156_containers.md) virtual machines are heavier, requiring:
    - hardware-based acceleration for best performance
    - gigabytes of disk space to store (due to requiring the kernel and everything else to be virtualized)
- However, they are often more scalable for a large monolithic application

Popular tools:

- VMware
- VirtualBox
- QEMU
- KVM/libvirt
- Xen
- Hyper-V
- [[20210118-200218_vagrant.md]] [Vagrant](20210118-200218_vagrant.md) (from HashiCorp) -- for automated provisioning of VMs, can leverage VirtualBox driver/backend (this appears to be the most popular option)
