#  Options for Consistent/Reproducible Development/Testing Environments

The two most popular options for enabling consistent and/or reproducible environments for development and testing of software appear to be:

- [[20210118-192156_containers.md]] [Containers](20210118-192156_containers.md)
- [[20210118-192202_vm.md]] [Virtual Machines](20210118-192202_vm.md)


- Almost always tied in with a CI/CD or Version Control System.
- Project to test is copied into a clean environment spun up for one specific test (few long-lived containers)
