### ... as opposed to VMware, Hyper-V, Parallels, libvirt, or (insert virtualization tool here)?

Oracle VM VirtualBox is the most well-supported virtualization backend suppoerted by Hashicorp Vagrant
that is also available for free on all major operating systems that students tend to use
(Windows, macOS, and most Linux-based/UNIX-like operating systems).

This enables a common abstraction for me (and the instructors) writing Vagrantfiles
as only one virtualization platform needs to be tested.
